# Weather-Webiste
This was my first project to develop a website that provided weather updates for each city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Before starting this project, I only had a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, and basic JavaScript syntax and functionality. Working on this project, I learned a lot and gained valuable experience, especially in integrating APIs to retrieve and display data.

Special Lessons:
Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: I honed my skills by applying these basic web development technologies to a real-world project.

API Integration: I learned how to integrate external APIs into my code, which was a new and exciting concept for me. This experience taught me how to fetch data from an API and have it processed.

Dynamic Content Handling: I developed the ability to use JavaScript to dynamically render images and text based on different weather conditions. This allowed for an interactive and highly interactive experience.This was my first project to develop a website that provided weather updates for each city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
